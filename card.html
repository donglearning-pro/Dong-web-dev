            <p>While meritocracy is often championed as the ultimate fair system, it harbors a subtle, authoritarian edge. By framing success as a direct result of individual "talent plus effort," it legitimizes a rigid social hierarchy. This creates a moralized divide: the winners feel entitled to their status, while the losers are told their failure is their own fault.
            Because the system claims to be objective, its outcomes become unquestionable. This stifles dissent and ignores structural inequities like inherited wealth or early-childhood resources. Ultimately, meritocracy can transform into a "tyranny of talent," where a technocratic elite exerts absolute control over social mobility, demanding constant, high-stakes performance that treats human worth as a mere data point in an efficiency equation.
