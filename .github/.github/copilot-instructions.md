Do not provide the full file. Only show the specific code snippets or functions that need to be changed or added.

Use concise explanations instead of verbose code blocks.

If the change is small, use comments like // ... existing code ... to omit parts that haven't changed.

Focus on logic and algorithms rather than boilerplate code
